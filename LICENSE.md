We are currently researching the best possible license for this project.
But for now, we have the following terms:

1. The Software and any modifications made to it may not be used for the purpose of training or improving machine learning algorithms,
including but not limited to artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or data mining. This condition applies to any derivatives,
modifications, or updates based on the Software code. Any usage of the Software in an AI-training dataset is considered a breach of this License.

2. The Software may not be included in any dataset used for training or improving machine learning algorithms,
including but not limited to artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or data mining.

3. Any person or organization found to be in violation of these restrictions will be subject to legal action and may be held liable
for any damages resulting from such use.

4. You are not allowed to use the engine, or any parts of this software for generative AI or create any software that uses them in any shape or form.
That includes using images made with stable diffusion, create AI generated voice acting, generated music and etc.

   You are also not allowed to use any code from generative AI to create your games.

   Only AI generative tools that create things from nothing are not allowed to be used. Tools that assist the creation of art, code and etc are allowed to
   be used.
