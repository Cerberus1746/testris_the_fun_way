* All public funtions must work in python and C++. Also they need to have
  a python unit test and fully documented.
* All API classes must have a isolated example usage. If the class is too
  complex and require multiple other classes to work, it will be necessary to
  create a sample project and then direct link to the file where the class is
  used
* use `auto` where possible.
* We use C++ modules. So we have very few include files only when they are
  required.
  At this moment (2024-09-18), the only toolset that works close to nicely with
  modules is LLVM-19 (Clang for compiler, Clangd for language server and etc)
* Python function names and classes must have the same as the C++ counterparts
  same for the argument names, if they are different for any reason. It MUST be
  specified in the documentation.
* You are **not** allowed to use any generative AI (ChatGPT, Copilot and
  similar) to contribute to this project for the following reasons:
    1. Fuck Generative AI.
    2. There are various open source projects that follows the same example
       because source code generated by generative AI is license tainted.
    3. Code generated by AI is trash anyway.

  Anyone that might argue against this or try to circunvent this rule will be
  immediately banned from the project. You are, of course, able to improve this
  text or do better wordings.
