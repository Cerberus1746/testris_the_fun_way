## Attention
This game engine is highly experimental, so much so the few libraries it uses
is using features and bugs fixed only available on either direct from the repos
or forks, so make sure to run:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will change once the features are out in releases.

If you are having issues with gcc-13 do like me and use the highest available
version of clang that you are able to install.

We also use [SEMVER](https://semver.org/) versioning system so consider this
engine an alpha before 0.8 and beta before 1.0.

# Clockwork Reverie

Hello, this will be a 2D and 3D game engine made from scratch, with as few
libraries as possible.

Why?
For learning purposes and because so far the majority of game engines I used
let me down somewhat.
